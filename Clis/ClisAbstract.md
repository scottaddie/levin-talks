# The Four CLIs of the Apocalypse

In the dark, dystopian land of Web Development, there are numerous ways to build and deploy apps. Unfortunately, the over-saturation of bloated, "must-have" tools causes decision paralasis. What if I told you there's an alternative whose sole mission is easing the development lifecycle?

Command-line interfaces are old as time. Why would any sane person recommend using a handful of them in modern app development? Ease of use. Time and time again, developers are forced to learn a new tool, investigate its intricacies, and master it. Then for no apparent reason, the tool doesn't serve its purpose in a particular case. It's thrown away, never to be used again. Simplicity and ease of adoption is key to success.

In this session, we'll use the power of the command line, with help from Visual Studio Code. We'll create, develop, build, and deploy an ASP.NET Core app to the cloud. All of this will be accomplished with Git Bash, .NET Core CLI, Angular CLI, and Azure CLI.
